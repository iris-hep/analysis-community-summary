## Run locally

First, create a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

The code will require a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) (PAT) to use, so you'll need to make one for this application.

Once you have one, you'll need to pass it in at the command line to `query.py`.
This is probably best done by setting an environment variable in a shell script and then passing it through

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

API_TOKEN='<your PAT goes here>'
python query.py "${API_TOKEN}"
```
